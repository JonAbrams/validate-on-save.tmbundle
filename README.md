Remember:

  1. saving
  2. switching to your browser
  3. refreshing 
  4. finding out you had a syntax error in your {PHP|Ruby|JavaScript} source code
  5. switching back to TextMate
  6. fixing the error
  7. saving
  8. switching back to the browser
  9. refreshing?

This bundle lets you skips several of those steps.
